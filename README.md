# PAWStrack - A Pet Record and Management System

This is our ```CS/CE 353/374 Software Engineering Project```, keeping in mind the needs and requirements of ```PAWS```, a local shelter in Karachi dedicated for sheltering and providing a safe haven for various stray animals, managed by Ahmed Bilal (a Research Assistant at our university).
The project aims to develop a record management system, not only for the shelter, but for their clients as well.
